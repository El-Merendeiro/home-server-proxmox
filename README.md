# üè† Home Server with Proxmox

My personal home server built with **Proxmox VE** as the hypervisor, running a mix of **LXC containers** and **Docker** services, featuring **GPU passthrough** for hardware acceleration, **secure remote access** via **Tailscale** for personal devices, and a dedicated **WireGuard VPN container** that routes all selected network traffic through the VPN tunnel.
